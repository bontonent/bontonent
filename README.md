### 🌟 About Me

- I like to **work on myself** and explore new technologies.
- You’ll find my most interesting and finished projects marked with a ⭐️ in my catalog.
- I value independence:  
  — Use <a href="https://github.com/tutao/tutanota" target="_blank">Tutanota</a> for email, learning privacy-first tools beyond Google.<br>
  — Daily driver: **Arch Linux + Hyprland** (I like to try new distros, check out my <a href="https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland" target="_blank">current dotfiles</a>).<br>
  — Typing on a custom split keyboard: <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware" target="_blank">QMK 3x6</a>.
